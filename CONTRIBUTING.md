## Adding new benchmarks

You can add new test cases by following these steps:

### Create new benchmark

Create a new script with `snake_case` naming that `extends Benchmark`,
then save it in one of the existing folders depending on its category.
If your benchmark does not suit any existing category or subcategory,
you can also create a new folder in the repository's root folder.

### Configure the benchmark

In the `_init()` function of your script, configure your benchmark by
initializing any desired `Benchmark` variables to true:

- `test_render_cpu`: Enable this for rendering benchmarks.
  Leave it disabled for other benchmarks.
- `test_render_gpu`: Enable this for rendering benchmarks.
  Leave it disabled for other benchmarks.
- `test_idle`: Enable this for non-rendering CPU-intensive benchmarks.
  Leave it disabled for other benchmarks.
- `test_physics`: Enable this for physics benchmarks.
  Leave it disabled for other benchmarks.
- > Leaving all of these disabled will only time the initial call to your `benchmark_` function (see below).

### Implement the benchmark

The runtime will scan your script for functions beginning with `benchmark_`.
For basic benchmarks, writing your code inside such a function is sufficient for it
to be automatically registered and become available for benchmarking by the user.
The runtime will end the benchmark once your function returns
and report the amount of time spent running inside it.

For more advanced benchmarks, the runtime expects the function to return a `Node`.
Return the appropriate node for your benchmark[^1] to signal to the runtime
that it should continue measuring system resource usage even after your function returns.
The runtime will add your node to the scene as a root node,
leave it running for a fixed amount of time (currently 5 seconds),
and then end the benchmark and report the various metrics configured above.

[^1]: For 3D rendering benchmarks, the root node should be Node3D. For 2D
rendering benchmarks, the root node should be Node2D. For UI benchmarks, the
root node should be Control. For scripting or miscellaneous benchmarks, the root
node should be Node.

Remember to follow the
[GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
when writing new scripts. Adding type hints is recommended whenever possible,
unless you are specifically benchmarking non-typed scripts.

> C# benchmark functions must begin with `Benchmark`, instead of `benchmark_`.  
> For C# benchmarks to be available, you must use the .NET version of the engine.

### Test the benchmark

1. Run the project in the editor.
2. Check the checkbox next to your newly added benchmark and click **Run** in the
   bottom-right corner.
3. Wait for the benchmark to complete.
4. If all goes well, the benchmark completion time should appear in the table for
   all enabled benchmarks (and all relevant metrics). Metrics that were disabled
   on a specific benchmarks will not display any result.

If the benchmark works as expected, congratulations! You can now open a pull request for it ðŸ™‚
