# Web interface for benchmark results

This website is built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.
It's designed to work **exclusively** with the [`run-benchmarks.sh` script](../run-benchmarks.sh),
which runs benchmarks on a dedicated server with various GPU models.

## How it works

- Using the [`run-benchmarks.sh` script](../run-benchmarks.sh), benchmark data
  is collected and saved to a single JSON file for each engine commit, with 4 runs:
  - CPU (debug template)
  - CPU (release template)
  - GPU (AMD, release template)
  - GPU (Intel, release template)
  <!-- - GPU (NVIDIA, release template) -->
- The produced results (as .json or .md) should be copied into the `src-data/benchmarks` folder.
- The [./generate-content.py script](./generate-content.py) produces `.md` files
  in the `content` folder, so that web pages can be generated for each graph and each benchmark.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is used to create a homepage listing recent
  benchmarked commits, plus a single page per engine commit. This allows linking
  to individual benchmarked commit in a future-proof way.
- [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/) is used to draw graphs on the homepage.
- [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/) is used to provide styling,
  including automatic dark theme support.

## Building

### Development

- Create JSON data or [fetch existing JSON data from the live website](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-benchmarks-results),
  and copy the JSON files into the `src-data/benchmarks` folder. Files should be named using format
  `YYYY-MM-DD_hash.json` where `hash` is a 9-character Git commit hash of the Godot build used
  (truncated from a full commit hash). The files can also have the `.md` extension
  (for backward compatibility), but they should still be JSON inside.
- Run [./generate-content.py](./generate-content.py). This should create `.md` pages in both the
  `content/benchmark` and the `content/graph` folders.
- Run `hugo server`.

### Production

- Follow the same steps as in the **Development** section above.
- Run `hugo --minify`.
