    This page tracks <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a> performance running on a
    <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-benchmarks">benchmark suite</a>.
    Benchmarks are run on a daily basis to track performance improvements and
    regressions over time.

  <h2>Benchmarking machine</h2>
  <p>
    To allow for direct GPU access and avoid performance fluctuations due to the
    use of a shared host, benchmarks are run on a dedicated server with the
    following hardware:

  <table class="table-first-column-align-right">
    <tr>
      <td>CPU</td>
      <td>Intel Core i5-12400</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

  </table>
  <p>
    All core and memory clocks are kept at stock frequencies. When running
    benchmarks (except for compiling the engine), The CPU governor is set to
    <code>performance</code> to improve result consistency. The OS is kept in a
    default configuration as closely as posible. The machine is not running any
    other tasks in parallel â€“ this page is served from GitHub Pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Benchmarks that make use of the GPU are run 3 times (once on each GPU with a release build).
    Benchmarks that don't make use of the GPU are run twice (once with a debug build, once with a release build).
